## extra
- This was primary made to work for dollhouse roleplay but should work on any other game that doesn't have much anti-exploit
- This script was made as a joke to clown on people using bots in dollhouse roleplay but it became a way to piss them off so I'm releasing it
- **I AM NOT TELLING OR SHOWING ANYONE HOW TO RUN A TON OF BOTS! FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF**
